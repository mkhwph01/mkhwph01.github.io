<h1>Stuff That I love To Do</h1>
<p>I am an outdoor guy, though I sometimes prefer to keep indoors if my outdoor experience promises to be no more fun than my apartment room. While not that creative about my outdoor activities, I still make the best of the few outdoor crafts I have mastered, and here I have made a list of them.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Playing and watching football</li>
  <li>Singing Kareoke</li>
  <li>Singing for business</li>
  <li>Biking</li>
</ul>
