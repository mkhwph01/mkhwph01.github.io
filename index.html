<h1>Welcome to my web page.</h1>
<h>My name is Philani Mkhwanazi, from Mbabane, Swaziland. I am in my junior year at Luther College studying Computer Science and Psychology as my major fields, and Chinese as my minor field of study. I will tell you a little bit about how I came to the decision to pursue such seemingly contrasting professional fields.</h>
<p>The things I find pleasure in doing can be found <a href="hobbies.html">here</a></p>

<p> <a href="gallery.html">Here</a> you will find some picture of the things I do during my spare time.</p>
