    <p>My name is Philani Mkhwanazi, from Mbabane, Swaziland. I am in my junior year at Luther College studying Computer Science 
    and Psychology as my major fields, and Chinese as my minor field of study. I will tell you a little bit about how I came to the
    decision to pursue such seemingly contrasting professional fields. I started off at Luther as a Psychology major, until my
    first spring semester at Luther, when one of my Psych classes prove to be a little too monotonous and repetitive for my high
    energy levels. I began searching for an alternative field, but was not ready to give up Psych. I ended up carrying on with
    both majors with advice from my academic advisor. With Chinese, I had not heard of the minor ever before, until my spring semester
    of sophomore year, but the idea sounded interesting, after all, it's one more language to the five I already speak, so I 
    took it. So that explains a little about my crazy life at Luther College.</p>
