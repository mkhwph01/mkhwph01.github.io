  <h3>About Myself</h3>
  
    <p>My name is Philani Mkhwanazi, from Mbabane, Swaziland. I am in my junior year at Luther College studying Computer Science and Psychology as my major fields, and Chinese as my minor field of study. I will tell you a little bit about how I came to the decision to pursue such seemingly contrasting professional fields.</p>

  <p>The things I find pleasure in doing can be found <a href="hobbies.html">here.</a></p>
