      <td>This is me pretending to be working hard. I work at the KWLC studios as a radio DJ,<br>
      music producer and sports director. I started off as a regular radio DJ because of my love<br>
      for classic country music. I did a country show there, and a few weeks later, due to my feel<br>
      for electronics, I was given the sports board operating job from which I was named KWLC's sports<br>
      director. I was later introduced to the KWLC recording studio, which I quickly had lots of interest<br> in.</td>

  <h4>And this, is me during the summer working on the Luther bus. This is one of my favorite jobs on campus as I really love cars.</h4>
