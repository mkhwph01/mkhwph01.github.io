        This is me pretending to be working hard. I work at the KWLC studios as a radio DJ,<br>
        music producer and sports director. I started off as a regular radio DJ because of my love<br>
        for classic country music. I did a country show there, and a few weeks later, due to my feel<br>
        for electronics, I was given the sports board operating job from which I was named KWLC's sports<br>
        director. I was later introduced to the KWLC recording studio, which I quickly had lots of interest<br> in.

      <td>This is my Linkedn profile picture. This picture was taken about three years ago when I was on<br>
      my way to a careers' fair in Swaziland. I looked poppen and hoppen and I think people really took me seriously that<br>
      day. I really think my shades are the best part of my outfit. They bring out the mysterious complex I<br>
      want my future bosses to know.
